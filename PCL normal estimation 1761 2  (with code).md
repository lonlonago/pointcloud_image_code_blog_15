 (2) Image integration 

 Integral image is a method for estimating the discovery of ordered point clouds. The algorithm takes the point cloud as a depth image and creates a certain rectangular area to calculate the normal, taking into account the adjacent pixel relationship without establishing a tree query structure. Therefore, it is very efficient.
