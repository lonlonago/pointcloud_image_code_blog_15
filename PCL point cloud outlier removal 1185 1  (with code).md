#  Statistical outlier removal 

 Principle: Traverse the point cloud, calculate the average distance between each point and its k nearest neighbor points, and then calculate the mean and standard deviation of all average distances. The distance threshold can be expressed as, Î± is a scaling coefficient, and once again traverse the point cloud, points with an average distance greater than k neighbor points are marked as outliers.

#  Radius outlier removal 

 Principle: Count the number of points in the neighborhood of a sphere with a radius from a point. If it is less than nb_points, mark the point as an outlier. Effect display:
